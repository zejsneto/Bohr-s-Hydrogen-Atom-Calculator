# Bohr-s-Hydrogen-Atom-Calculator

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description

A simple bohr's hydrogen atom calculator with a terminal menu, developed with Python.<br>
This calculator is a project of the `Modern Physics IV` subject (Python).<br>
Coded in 2021.2 at the [FEI](https://portal.fei.edu.br/) college, located in S√£o Bernardo do Campo/SP/BR.<br>

‚ö†Ô∏èSome of the code and other parts may be in Portuguese, work in progress for English.

## üìÉ Obligations

Write a Python language program related to the hydrogen atom and the Bohr model. The program will have several calculations, so the team should include a menu of options so that the user can choose the tool he needs (e.g., conversion of energy from electron-volt to joule, calculation of the quantum levels of the H atom, etc).

The program must be shared among team members: no excuse will be accepted about access to the program if one of the team members misses the class. Each project must be developed by the team itself: programs with partial or full plagiarism will not be considered for evaluation.

# General instructions:<br>
‚Ä¢ Outputs with numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãin scientific notation for very large or very small numbers; must have 3 significant figures. This does not apply for the quantum number, which must be an integer.

‚Ä¢ Physical parameters must be displayed with units, both at the input and at the output.

‚Ä¢ Empathize with the user: Expose well-organized menus and outputs that are updated for each new input or that are easily identified after multiple calculations

‚Ä¢ Empathize with the user: after a calculation is complete, display the options menu again for further studies. (So ‚Äã‚Äãthat the user doesn't have to compile the program each time he wants to do a calculation).

# Minimum program functions:<br>
Use constants with 4 significant figures in the program: Planck's constant, elementary charge, electron mass, Rydberg's constant, etc.

For a given value of n, calculate
The. the radius of the electron's orbit,
B. electron speed in orbit,
√ß. De Broglie wavelength of the n-level electron,
d. the kinetic energy at the n level,
and. potential energy at the n level,
f. total energy at level n.
Pay attention to the signs of the energies and n must be an integer. Return an error message if the user enters a non-integer number. Some energies can be negative, eg in the case of binding energy.

Calculate the energy, wavelength and frequency of the photon emitted/absorbed by the hydrogen atom in the transition from an initial level ni to another level nf, that is, when making a ‚Äúquantum leap‚Äù. Since ni can be greater or less than nf, care must be taken not to return negative values.

Calculate the final n level (nf) after the hydrogen atom in the initial level (ni) absorbs a photon with a given wavelength or frequency entered by the user. Note that: i) the hydrogen atom will only absorb photons with specific energies; ii) the value of n must be an integer, therefore, it would be interesting to show the nf calculated to two decimal places and the one rounded to an integer.

Calculate the initial n level (ni) of the electron in the hydrogen atom from which the decay to the (nf) level occurs with the emission of a photon with a given wavelength or frequency entered by the user. Since the value of n must be an integer, it would be interesting to show the calculated ni, with two decimal places, and the one rounded to a whole number.

# Checklist of program functions:<br>
Input the quantum number (n) of the hydrogen atom. Calculate:
The. rn
B. vn
√ß. ÔÅ¨n
d. kn
and. Un
f. in

Input of the initial state ni and final state nf of the electron in the H atom. Depending on whether the process is decay or excitation, ni can be greater or less than nf, so be careful not to return negative values). Calculate:
The. And the photon absorbed or emitted
B. ÔÅ¨ of the absorbed or emitted photon
√ß. f of the absorbed or emitted photon

i) Entry of the initial ni level of the electron in the H atom and frequency of the absorbed photon.
ii) Initial ni entry of the electron in the H atom and ÔÅ¨ of the absorbed photon.

Calculate: a. Level n after photon absorption (show calculated value to two decimal places and rounded from n)

i) Input of the frequency of the photon emitted in the transition to the final level nf entered by the user.
iii) Input of ÔÅ¨ of the photon emitted in the transition to the final level nf entered by the user.
Calculate: b. Level n before photon emission (show calculated value to two decimal places and rounded from n)

It is not mandatory that the calculations are organized in the way shown above. It was organized in this way to serve as a checklist. By minimal functions: means that the team can implement other features that make it easier to answer the questionnaire in part b of the activity.
